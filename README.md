## Peerlist Gen AI Hackathon- Mera Mann
## Inspiration
In college, we have seen ourselves and our colleagues struggle a lot with stress, anxiety and other ailments which they can't explain. There's still a lot of stigma to talk about it. They also have privacy concerns if they want to talk about it. Considering mental health to be really important in today's age, we have come to realise to build a platform where they could talk, express and get adequate healthcare. We believe in a holistic well being therefore our methods are more about make people better at managing their health before it worsens and becomes out of control.
## What it does
Our project aims to cater to mental health needs of individuals. Currently there are not many platforms which provide education, self care, and a holistic approach towards mental healthcare. Our website takes care of all these needs and also has a great ChatBot which gives amazing suggestions to manage one's mental health.
## How we built it
We have created a web application which uses a client-server architecture.
Technical components: 
Frontend: ChatBot, React, Redux
Backend: NodeJS, ExpressJS
Languages: JavaScript, HTML,CSS
Chatbot: OpenAI
## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we faced during building our code was that of how to build a chatbot. Initially we had went with a custom  model made using tensorflow. But during testing we found that users found the chatbot basic and its repsonse generic. Then we went back to the drawing board on how to make the chatbot more interactive. First we thought on increasing the dataset but we couldn't find any. Then we decided to use openai gpt model. Intially we decided to use davinci model but we found that it was more suited towards general chatting. Hence we settled on gpt3.5 turbo which was highly optimised for chating with context saving
## What we learned
We learned how to integrate gpt with react
## What's next for Mera Mann
The future/next steps for our solution are to deploy it and add some features that we were unable to add. # Hackbattle-Mobile-vs-Web-Mera-Mann
